# Sliding Puzzle
## Description
A basic sliding puzzle game in Rust using [macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/). When the game starts it loads the images in the img/ directory in sequential order, starting at 01.png. The images *must* be 600x600 pngs in order to function. Such images can be found by using the query "*image* filetype:png 600x600" in a search engine like google and checking the images section. An alternative would be to also resize the image using a program like paint
## How to run
Install rust and then run `cargo build` to install dependancies and build the application and then `cargo run` to run the executable
